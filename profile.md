# Research Profile

**Name:** Amogha Rao
**Status:** Undergraduate, Software Engineering

## Research Interests

* Causal debugging and fault modeling
* Transition invariants and state safety
* Backend systems and distributed execution
* Concurrency, race conditions, and failure prevention

## Current Work

I am building a causal debugging research lab focused on understanding why recurring production failures persist and how invariant-level reasoning can eliminate fault-producing execution paths.

## Goal

To pursue advanced research in Software Engineering and Systems, and to develop formal, causal debugging methodologies applicable to real-world backend and distributed systems.
