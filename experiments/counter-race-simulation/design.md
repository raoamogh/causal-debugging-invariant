# Counter Race Simulation

## Objective
Simulate concurrent counter updates with and without atomic transition invariants to measure failure recurrence.

## Hypothesis
Enforcing transition invariants will eliminate negative counter states and reduce failure recurrence to zero.

## Metrics
- Failure recurrence rate
- Mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR)
