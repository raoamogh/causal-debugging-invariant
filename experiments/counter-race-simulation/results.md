# Results

| Configuration | Failures Observed | Final Counter Value |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Without transition invariants | 3610 | 18 |
| With transition invariants | 0 | 39 |

These results demonstrate that enforcing transition invariants eliminates failure-producing execution paths entirely, while meaning invariants merely detect failures after they occur.
