# Causal Debugging Model

Error → Bug → Failure

Errors are human reasoning mistakes about system behavior.
Bugs are latent faults introduced into system design or code.
Failures are observable incorrect runtime behavior.

Debugging that targets failures suppresses symptoms.
Debugging that enforces transition invariants eliminates causal fault paths.
